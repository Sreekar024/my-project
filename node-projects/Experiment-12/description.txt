This is an Express.js server that provides a simple REST API to manage a collection of cards. It supports:
->GET / – Returns the request URL and method.
->GET /cards – Returns all cards.
->GET /cards/:id – Returns a single card by ID.
-POST /cards – Adds a new card (requires suit and value).
->DELETE /cards/:id – Removes a card by ID.
->PATCH /update and POST /submit – Simple test endpoints.
The server uses express.json() middleware to parse JSON request bodies, and all routes return responses in JSON format.
