  Interactive SVG Drawing Tool with Mouse Event Handlers

->Objective
  To develop an interactive drawing tool using SVG and JavaScript, 
  where users can draw freehand paths with the mouse. 
  The project aims to demonstrate handling mouse events, 
  SVG path creation, and dynamic rendering in real time.

->Task Description
  1: Create an SVG drawing area inside a styled container.
  2: When the user presses the mouse (mousedown), a new path is started in the SVG.
  3: As the mouse moves (mousemove), line segments are continuously added to the path, creating a freehand drawing effect.
  4: On releasing the mouse (mouseup), the drawing stops and the path is finalized.
  5: CSS is applied to style the container and SVG area for a neat drawing interface.

->Expected Output
  1: A clean SVG canvas where users can draw freehand paths with the mouse.
  2: Smooth drawing lines in blue color, adjustable via stroke attributes.
  3: Drawing stops automatically when the mouse is released.
  4: A user-friendly and responsive drawing tool.

->CSS Styling Breakdown
  1: body → Provides text alignment, font, and spacing.
  2: .container → Frames the SVG canvas with borders and padding.
  3: svg → Defines drawing area size, border, background, and cursor style (crosshair).

->Learning Outcomes
  1: Learn how to use SVG elements dynamically with JavaScript.
  2: Understand mouse event handling (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup).
  3: Implement freehand drawing using SVG path commands.
  4: Gain hands-on experience in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive graphics.
