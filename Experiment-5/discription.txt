  Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown using JavaScript DOM Manipulation

->Objective
  To create a web-based product list that can be dynamically filtered and displayed according to the user’s selection from a dropdown menu. The objective is to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates without reloading the page.

->Task Description
  1: Build a simple web page that displays a list of products (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Books).
  2: Add a dropdown menu with filter options like All, Clothing, Electronics, Books above the product list.
  3: When the user selects a category, the product list updates instantly to show only products belonging to that category.
  4: If "All" is selected, the full product list is displayed again.
  5: The filtering must be implemented using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.
  6: CSS should be applied to style the container, dropdown, and product list for better readability and UI.

->Expected Output:
  1: The web page initially shows all products in a styled list.
  2: Selecting a specific category hides other products and displays only the matching ones.
  3: The changes occur dynamically without refreshing the page.
  4: A clean and user-friendly interface with styled dropdown and product list.

->CSS Styling Breakdown
  1: body → Provides overall background, padding, and font styling for readability.
  2: .container → Creates a white box layout with padding, border, and max-width for neat alignment.
  3: h2 → Styles the heading with spacing
  4: #category → Styles the dropdown with margin and padding.
  5: #product-list li → Adds borders, spacing, and rounded corners for each product item.

->Learning Outcomes
  1: Understanding how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in a project.
  2: Learning how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
  3: Using event listeners to handle user interactions.
  4: Gaining hands-on practice in building a dynamic filtering feature without reloading a page.
